	:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(spi, [int], [level])
-------------------------------------
Notes:
	* Formula and BASE_REGEN values derived by Whitetooth (hotdogee [at] gmail [dot] com)
	* Calculates the mana regen per 5 seconds from spirit when out of 5 second rule for given intellect and level.
	* Player class is no longer a parameter
	* ManaRegen(SPI, INT, LEVEL) = (0.001+SPI*BASE_REGEN[LEVEL]*(INT^0.5))*5
Arguments:
	number - Spirit
	[optional] number - Intellect. Default: player's intellect
	[optional] number - Level used in calculations. Default: player's level
Returns:
	; mp5o5sr : number - Mana regen per 5 seconds when out of 5 second rule
	; statid : string - "MANA_REG_NOT_CASTING"
Example:
	local mp5o5sr = StatLogic:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(1) -- GetNormalManaRegenPerSpi
	local mp5o5sr = StatLogic:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(10, 15)
	local mp5o5sr = StatLogic:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(10, 15, 70)

--=====================================--
-- Avoidance stats diminishing returns --
--=====================================--
-- Formula reverse engineered by Whitetooth (hotdogee [at] gmail [dot] com)
--[[---------------------------------
This includes
1. Dodge from Dodge Rating, Defense, Agility.
2. Parry from Parry Rating, Defense.
3. Chance to be missed from Defense.

The following is the result of hours of work gathering data from beta servers and then spending even more time running multiple regression analysis on the data.

1. DR for Dodge, Parry, Missed are calculated separately.
2. Base avoidances are not affected by DR, (ex: Dodge from base Agility)
3. Death Knight's Parry from base Strength is affected by DR, base for parry is 5%.
4. Direct avoidance gains from talents and spells(ex: Evasion) are not affected by DR.
5. Indirect avoidance gains from talents and spells(ex: +Agility from Kings) are affected by DR
6. c and k values depend on class but does not change with level.

7. The DR formula:

1/x' = 1/c+k/x

x' is the diminished stat before converting to IEEE754.
x is the stat before diminishing returns.
c is the cap of the stat, and changes with class.

	:GetDodgePerAgi()
-------------------------------------
Arguments:
	None
Returns:
	; dodge : number - Dodge percentage per agility
	; statid : string - "DODGE"
Notes:
	* Formula by Whitetooth (hotdogee [at] gmail [dot] com)
	* Calculates the dodge percentage per agility for your current class and level.
	* Only works for your currect class and current level, does not support class and level args.
	* Calculations got a bit more complicated with the introduction of the avoidance DR in WotLK, these are the values we know or can be calculated easily:
	** D'=Total Dodge% after DR
	** D_r=Dodge from Defense and Dodge Rating before DR
	** D_b=Dodge unaffected by DR (BaseDodge + Dodge from talent/buffs + Lower then normal defense correction)
	** A=Total Agility
	** A_b=Base Agility (This is what you have with no gear on)
	** A_g=Total Agility - Base Agility
	** Let d be the Dodge/Agi value we are going to calculate.

	#  1     1     k
	# --- = --- + ---
	#  x'    c     x

	# x'=D'-D_b-A_b*d
	# x=A_g*d+D_r

	# 1/(D'-D_b-A_b*d)=1/C_d+k/(A_g*d+D_r)=(A_g*d+D_r+C_d*k)/(C_d*A_g*d+C_d*D_r)

	# C_d*A_g*d+C_d*D_r=[(D'-D_b)-A_b*d]*[Ag*d+(D_r+C_d*k)]

	# After rearranging the terms, we get an equation of type a*d^2+b*d+c where
	# a=-A_g*A_b
	# b=A_g(D'-D_b)-A_b(D_r+C_d*k)-C_dA_g
	# c=(D'-D_b)(D_r+C_d*k)-C_d*D_r
	** Dodge/Agi=(-b-(b^2-4ac)^0.5)/(2a)

Notes:
	* Avoidance DR formula and k, C_p, C_d constants derived by Whitetooth (hotdogee [at] gmail [dot] com)
	* avoidanceBeforeDR is the part that is affected by diminishing returns.
	* See :GetClassIdOrName(class) for valid class values.
	* Calculates the avoidance after diminishing returns, this includes:
	*# Dodge from Dodge Rating, Defense, Agility.
	*# Parry from Parry Rating, Defense.
	*# Chance to be missed from Defense.
	* The DR formula: 1/x' = 1/c+k/x
	** x' is the diminished stat before converting to IEEE754.
	** x is the stat before diminishing returns.
	** c is the cap of the stat, and changes with class.
	** k is is a value that changes with class.
	* Formula details:
	*# DR for Dodge, Parry, Missed are calculated separately.
	*# Base avoidances are not affected by DR, (ex: Dodge from base Agility)
	*# Death Knight's Parry from base Strength is affected by DR, base for parry is 5%.
	*# Direct avoidance gains from talents and spells(ex: Evasion) are not affected by DR.
	*# Indirect avoidance gains from talents and spells(ex: +Agility from Kings) are affected by DR
	*# c and k values depend on class but does not change with level.
