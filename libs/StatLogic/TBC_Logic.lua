{	:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(spi, [int], [level])
-------------------------------------
-- Description
	Calculates the mana regen per 5 seconds while NOT casting from spirit.
-- Args
	spi
			number - spirit
	[int] - (defaults: PlayerInt)
			number - intellect
	[level] - (defaults: PlayerLevel)
			number - player level used for calculation
-- Returns
	[mp5nc]
		number - mana regen per 5 seconds when out of combat
	[statid]
		string - "MANA_REG_NOT_CASTING"
-- Remarks
	Player class is no longer a parameter
	ManaRegen(SPI, INT, LEVEL) = (0.001+SPI*BASE_REGEN[LEVEL]*(INT^0.5))*5
-- Examples
	StatLogic:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(1) -- GetNormalManaRegenPerSpi
	StatLogic:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(10, 15)
	StatLogic:GetNormalManaRegenFromSpi(10, 15, 70)
